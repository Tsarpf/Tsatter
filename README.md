[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Tsarpf/Tsatter.svg?token=dpDDmxyBN2PpMoNQcvmf&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Tsarpf/Tsatter)

######Stuff:
- Uses custom MEAN.
- CI using Travis-CI, since you have access to this repo you should be able to access the build statuses etc through travis web page
- Custom CD, live here: http://datisbox.net:7247/ (7247 == tsat in leet)
- HTML templating with Jade so we don't have to write actual shitty html. (Should work well with angular as well)


##Old implementation in the old branch.
